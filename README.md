## Overview

This repository contains algorithms for grid based motion planning using A* and RRT. The problems are based in R^2 and utilizes a a [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) graph for the the mapping

## Features

- **RRT Planner**: Basic sampling-based planner with `--show-tree` visualization  
- **A\***: Optimal grid search with customizable sampler (`lattice` vs. `Halton`)
- **tradeoff-analysis**:
